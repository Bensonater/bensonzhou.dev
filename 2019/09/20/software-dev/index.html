        <p>In this post I will make a summary for the different stages in the making of software. I’ll also compare some of the common methods used.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<h2 id="Analysis"><a href="#Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Analysis"></a>Analysis</h2><p>Before a problem can be solved, it must be defined. The requirements of the system that solves the problem must be established. In the case of a data processing system, or for example the construction of a website, this could cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data - its origin, uses, volumes and characteristics</li>
<li>The procedures - what is done, where, when and how, and how errors and exceptions are handled</li>
<li>The future - development plans and expected growth rates</li>
<li>Problems with any existing system</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Design"><a href="#Design" class="headerlink" title="Design"></a>Design</h2><p>Depending on the type of project, the systems designer may consider some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Processing - the algorithms and appropriate modular structure for the solution, specifying modules with clear documented interfaces</li>
<li>Data structures - how data will be held and how it will be accessed. For example in a dynamic data structure such as a queue or tree, or in a file or database</li>
<li>Output - content, format, sequence, frequency, medium (Screen or hard copy) etc.</li>
<li>Input - volume, frequency, documents used, input methods</li>
<li>User interface - screens and dialogues, menus, special-purpose requirements</li>
<li>Security - how the data is to be kept secure from accidental corruption or deliberate tampering or hacking</li>
<li>Hardware - selection of an appropriate configuration</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Programming-and-Testing"><a href="#Programming-and-Testing" class="headerlink" title="Programming and Testing"></a>Programming and Testing</h2><h3 id="Black-box-testing"><a href="#Black-box-testing" class="headerlink" title="Black box testing"></a>Black box testing</h3><p>Black box testing is carried out independently of the code used in the program. It involves looking at the program specification and creating a set of test data that covers all the inputs and outputs and program functions</p>
<h3 id="White-box-testing"><a href="#White-box-testing" class="headerlink" title="White box testing"></a>White box testing</h3><p>White box testing is dependent on the code logic, and derives from the program structure rather than its function. The program code is studied and tests are devised which test each possible path at least once. The weakness of white box testing is that it will not detect missing functions.</p>
<h3 id="Alpha-testing"><a href="#Alpha-testing" class="headerlink" title="Alpha testing"></a>Alpha testing</h3><p>Alpha testing is carried out by the software developer’s in-house testing team. It is essentially because it often reveals both errors and omissions in the system requirements definition. The user may discover that the system does not in fact have the required functionality because the requirements were not specified carefully enough, or because the developer has overlooked or misunderstood something in the specification.</p>
<h3 id="Beta-testing"><a href="#Beta-testing" class="headerlink" title="Beta testing"></a>Beta testing</h3><p>When a new package is being developed for release as a software package, beta testing is often used. This involves giving the package to a number of potential users who agree to use the system and report any problems to the developers. This exposes the product to real use and detects problems and errors that may not have been anticipated by the developers.</p>
<h2 id="The-waterfall-lifecycle-model"><a href="#The-waterfall-lifecycle-model" class="headerlink" title="The waterfall lifecycle model"></a>The waterfall lifecycle model</h2><p>The waterfall model illustrates the methodology described above, in which each step is completed one at a time from beginning to end. Each step has specific outputs that lead into the next step. It is possible to return to a previous step if necessary but the model shows that the developers then have to work back down through the following stages.</p>
<p>The user is involved at the start of the process in the analysis stage, but then has little input until the evaluation stage.</p>
<p>The full steps of a waterfall lifecycle model is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analysis</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Implementation</li>
<li>Evaluation</li>
<li>Maintenance</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Spiral-model"><a href="#Spiral-model" class="headerlink" title="Spiral model"></a>Spiral model</h2><p>The spiral model uses the same structured steps but introduces the idea of developing the software in iterative stages. At the start of the process the requirements are defined and the developers work towards an initial prototype. Each successive loop around the spiral generates a refined prototype until the product is finished.</p>
<ol>
<li>Analysis</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Implementation</li>
<li>Evaluation</li>
<li>Maintenance</li>
<li>Start the loop again back at analysis</li>
</ol>
<p>Each time around the spiral the following activities are performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyse the requirements for the next prototype</li>
<li>Design the next version, the new prototype</li>
<li>Implement(code and test) the new prototype</li>
<li>Evaluate the new prototype, which generates a plan for the next iteration</li>
</ul>
<p>The spiral model is mostly used for large scale projects, for example, projects that take years to deliver. Smaller projects use a variation on this called the <a href="#agile-modelling">Agile Model</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Agile-Modelling"><a href="#Agile-Modelling" class="headerlink" title="Agile Modelling"></a>Agile Modelling</h2><p>At all stages of analysis, design and implementation, an agile approach may be adopted, as the stages of software development may not be completed in a linear sequence. It might be that some analysis is done and then some parts of a system are designed and implemented while other parts are still being analysed and then, for example, implementations and testing may be intermixed. the developer may then go back to design another aspect of the system.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, feedback will be obtained from the user. This is an iterative process during which changes made are incremental as the next part of the system is built.</p>
<p>The full steps of an agile model are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requirement gathering</li>
<li>Quick design</li>
<li>Build prototype</li>
<li>Customer evaluation</li>
<li>Refine prototype (may move back to quick design)</li>
<li>Create final system</li>
</ol>
<p>At each stage, a prototype is built with user participation to ensure that the system is being developed in line with what the user wants. The success of the software depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping the model simple, and not trying to incorporate features which may come in useful at a later date</li>
<li>Rapid feedback from the user</li>
<li>Understanding that user requirements may change during development as they are forced to consider their needs in detail</li>
<li>Being prepared to make incremental changes as the model develops</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Extreme-programming"><a href="#Extreme-programming" class="headerlink" title="Extreme programming"></a>Extreme programming</h2><p>Extreme programming is a software development technique which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. It is a type of agile software development in which frequent ‘releases’ of the software are made in short development cycles. This is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.</p>
<h2 id="Rapid-application-development"><a href="#Rapid-application-development" class="headerlink" title="Rapid application development"></a>Rapid application development</h2><p>Some very large projects may be developed over a long period of time during which both technology and user requirements change. Major changes at late stages of development can sometimes lead to projects being cancelled or restarted, at considerable costs. In response to this problem the RAD methodology was introduced, offering the promise of much faster completion of major projects. The ideas behind it include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workshops and focus groups to gather requirements rather than a formal requirement document</li>
<li>The use of prototyping to continually refine the system in response to user involvement and feedback</li>
<li>Producing within a strict time limit each part of the system, which may not be perfect but which is good enough</li>
<li>Reusing any software components which have already been used elsewhere</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Merits-and-drawbacks-of-each-method"><a href="#Merits-and-drawbacks-of-each-method" class="headerlink" title="Merits and drawbacks of each method"></a>Merits and drawbacks of each method</h2><p>The <a href="#the-waterfall-lifecycle-model">waterfall system lifecycle</a> approach is suitable for very small projects which need careful supervision, such as those undertaken by students or trainees. The absence of user involvement is a serious drawback.</p>
<p>The <a href="#spiral-model">spiral model</a> and the <a href="#agile-modelling">agile approach</a> are an improvement in that they acknowledge that users often cannot specify the requirements accurately because they don’t understand what is possible. It is much easier to examine a working prototype and figure out what needs to be done to turn it into a useful system.</p>
<p><a href="#extreme-programming">Extreme programming</a> and <a href="#rapid-application-development">rapid application development</a> are good methodologies for large projects when there is a danger of getting bogged down or sidetracked by suggested improvements, so that developers are constantly chasing a moving target.</p>
